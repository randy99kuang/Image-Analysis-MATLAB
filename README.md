# Image-Analysis-MATLAB

This repository contains code used for biomedical engineering research at Professor Martinez's lab at Purdue University.
The MATLAB code is able to perform a colorimetric analysis on images of an electrochemical device that was developed in the lab 
and extract information from the colors present in the image. The file "named colorAnalysisCommented.m" contains the primary image analysis code. In addition, it has thorough documentation regarding what each section of the code is responsible for.
