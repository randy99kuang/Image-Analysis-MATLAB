# Image-Analysis-MATLAB

This repository contains code used for biomedical engineering research at Professor Martinez's lab at Purdue University.
The MATLAB code is able to perform a colorimetric analysis on images of an electrochemical device that was developed in the lab 
and extract information from the colors present in the image.
